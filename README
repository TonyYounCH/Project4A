The main purpose of this project is to implement a working program that interacts with human and outside physical world. In order to do so, the beaglebone uses two module : the button to interact with human and the sensor to interact with ouside world. 


##################
#    lab4b.c     #
##################

It contains dummmy code that defines mraa variables and functions in case -DDUMMY option is specified when compiling. If so, it uses pre-defined functions instead of ones from mraa.h and mraa/aio.h in order to deal with not-working mraa-[gpio, aio] mapping. 

The program accepts three options (period=#, scale=[C, F], log=filename). If not specified, period and scale are allocated with default value of 1 and F.

It first initializes sensors (temp sensor and button) and for every period, it prints out time and current temperature in C or F depending on current scale. 

Then, we use poll to read from stdin and process whatever input to change current status (START/STOP, PERIOD, SCALE...).


##################
#    Makefile    #
##################

default : build your program (compiling with the -Wall and -Wextra options).
check : execute an automated smoke-test of your application to see if it runs and can talk to its sensors.
clean : delete all programs and output generated by the Makefile
dist : (runnable on a Linux desktop or server) create the deliverable tarball
