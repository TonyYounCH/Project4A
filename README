Project4B is divided into parts :
	- Do performance instrumentation and measurement to confirm the cause of the problem.
	- Implement a new option to divide a list into sublists and support synchronization on sublists, thus allowing parallel access to the (original) list.
	- Do new performance measurements to confirm that the problem has been solved.
